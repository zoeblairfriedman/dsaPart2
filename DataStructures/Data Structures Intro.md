Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the function or operations that can be applied to the data. 

Some are highly specialized, while others are more generally used. 

An array is a data structure.

Map/location data ——> you might want to use a graph
An ordered list with fast inserts and removals at the beginning and the end? --> you would want a linked list!
Web scraping nexted HTML? —> you will be getting data in a tree?
Writing a scheduler? --> you might want a binary heap


LISTS ARE GOOD FOR QUICK INSERTION AND DELETION
in arrays insertion and deletion can be expensive
